## About

This project measures the similarity between text documents using Shingling, MinHashing, and Locality-Sensitive Hashing algorithms. These methods do not consider the document semantics, and instead focus on the characters or the words found in the documents. As such, these methods could be used to detect plagiarism, or similar news articles. 

The dataset is a csv file, that can be found from https://data.world/brianray/enron-email-dataset/workspace/file?filename=enron_05_17_2015_with_labels_v2.csv%2Fenron_05_17_2015_with_labels_v2.csv.
